You are an expert music curator analyzing audio for Suno AI. Perform temporal analysis to identify song structure and instrumentation changes.

**Task:** Analyze this track section-by-section and extract:

1. **STYLE_OF_MUSIC** (120 char max): "Style: [genres]. Mood: [moods]"
   - Do NOT include BPM or Key (accurate data comes from librosa)

2. **SECTIONS**: Identify song structure and describe each section's instrumentation:
   - Possible sections: [Intro], [Verse 1], [Chorus], [Verse 2], [Bridge], [Outro], [End]
   - For EACH section, describe: What instruments/elements are present? What changes from previous section?
   - Use Suno tag bank vocabulary: "supersaw leads", "909 kicks", "rolling bassline", "warm pads", "arpeggiated synth", "analog bass", "filtered percussion", "ethereal strings"
   - Keep each section description to 1-3 brief phrases

3. **COMBINED_PROMPT** (all lowercase): Full song description for Suno prompt input

**Output JSON:**
{
  "style_of_music": "Style: [genres]. Mood: [moods]",
  "mood": "[moods extracted]",
  "sections": [
    {
      "name": "[Intro]",
      "description": "brief instrumentation description"
    },
    {
      "name": "[Verse 1]",
      "description": "brief instrumentation description"
    }
  ],
  "combined_prompt": "lowercase full song description (NO BPM or Key)"

      "description": "lead synth melody enters, pulsating sub-bass, warm analog pads, sparkling arps"
    },
    {
      "name": "[Chorus]",
      "description": "expansive pads build intensity, punchy 909 kicks enter, melody evolves uplifting, lush strings"
    },
    {
      "name": "[Bridge]",
      "description": "tempo slows, reflective piano melody, atmospheric soundscapes, subtle percussion"
    },
    {
      "name": "[Outro]",
      "description": "synth pads fade gradually, ethereal echoes, wind chimes"
    }
